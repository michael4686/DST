### Phone Data Scraper and Cleaner

#### Objective

The primary goal of this project was to scrape, clean, and store mobile phone data from the Noon website into a MongoDB database for further analysis.

#### Steps and Methodologies

1. _Data Extraction:_

   - _Web Scraping:_ Implemented web scraping using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to extract phone details from the Noon website. Key features extracted include phone names, images, price, number of sells, ratings, descriptions, and specifications.
   - _Link Collection:_ Compiled links for phone details by iterating over multiple pages to maximize data collection.

2. _Data Cleaning:_

   - Addressed inconsistencies and missing values by setting default values for attributes that were not present.
   - Standardized extracted fields into a structured format using Pandas, which included features like 'RAM Size', 'Battery Size', 'Internal Memory', and information about the phone manufacturer and operating system.

3. _Data Storage:_

   - Stored the cleaned data into a MongoDB database, allowing for easy retrieval and use in analytical tasks.

#### Outcomes

- Developed a comprehensive dataset containing key attributes of mobile phones available on Noon.
- Facilitated storage of information in MongoDB for scalable access and processing.

#### Tools and Libraries

- _Programming Language:_ Python
- _Libraries Used:_ BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, pymongo
- _Database:_ MongoDB

#### Challenges and Solutions

- _Challenge:_ Handling variable HTML structures.

  - _Solution:_ Used robust parsing logic with fallback/default data to handle missing fields and variable structures.

- _Challenge:_ Efficiently storing and accessing data.
  - _Solution:_ MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling JSON-like documents.

### Phone Price Prediction Model

#### Objective

This project aimed to build predictive models to estimate phone prices based on technical specifications and features using machine learning algorithms.

#### Steps and Methodologies

1. _Data Preprocessing:_

   - Loaded data from a CSV file resulting from a previous aggregation of MongoDB data.
   - Performed data cleaning by replacing missing values with statistical measures and encoding categorical variables.
   - Prepared the dataset for modeling by splitting it into feature sets and target variable.

2. _Model Training & Evaluation:_

   - _Models Used:_
     - Linear Regression: Basic implementation for establishing a performance baseline.
     - Random Forest Regressor: Employed an ensemble learning technique to enhance prediction accuracy.
     - XGBoost Regressor: Used for its efficiency and high performance in regression tasks.
   - _Evaluation Metric:_ The key metric used for evaluation was Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing a measure of prediction accuracy.

3. _Hyperparameter Tuning:_

   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV to find the optimal model configuration.

4. _Serialization:_

   - Saved the trained models using Joblib to facilitate future prediction tasks without re-training.

#### Outcomes

- Successfully built and evaluated multiple models with Random Forest and XGBoost showing promising results in terms of accuracy.
- Established a benchmark for pricing predictions using a structured ML pipeline.

#### Tools and Libraries

- _Programming Language:_ Python
- _Libraries Used:_ pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib

#### Challenges and Solutions

- _Challenge:_ Handling imbalanced or missing data.

  - _Solution:_ Systematic imputation strategies and robust encoding were employed to maintain data integrity.

- _Challenge:_ Optimizing model parameters.
  - _Solution:_ Implemented GridSearchCV for efficient tuning of model parameters.

### Conclusion

Both projects demonstrate a complete end-to-end data science process from data extraction to machine learning model deployment. The structured approach of selecting and implementing the correct tools and methodologies provided actionable insights into each task. Continuous evaluation and model tuning were crucial in enhancing the predictive capabilities of the algorithms, while MongoDB served as an effective storage solution for handling large-scale, structured data.

### Recommendations

- _For the Web Scraping Project:_
  - Consider employing automated scraping tools and a robust data validation step to ensure high-quality data collection.
- _For the Price Prediction Project:_
  - Continuous model validation and retraining with updated data can improve prediction accuracy. Exploring deep learning models could also provide additional predictive power for complex datasets.
